Alternate history in  which Germany won World War II, and a daughter of Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's  propaganda minister, has become a renowned revolutionary anarchist. Hilda  Goebbels likens her own disillusionment with Germany with Emma Goldman's  Disillusionment with Russia. Well-written, but the story-line is  disappointing. The author is prone to suggesting that as an anarchist Goebbels  should share his romantic view of the American dream.
