**Not yet translated into English**. Treated amply by [Mariano Martín Rodríguez](https://publish.lib.umd.edu/scifi/article/view/278/41), who says of it that it "presents a society following libertarian communist principles in a technologically advanced future. This is a consumerist society, fully democratic and sexually liberated—homosexuality is not an issue, and even one of the love interests in the novel is queer—but it is not a truly anarchist utopia", but is more by way of being a utopian novel. For Rodriguez, it remains "the best example of pro-anarchist Spanish speculative fiction".
