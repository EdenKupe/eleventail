 Proto-sf fantastic voyage, in which a traveller arrives in Australia, to find a  utopia of hermaphrodites made possible in part because there can be no issues  based on sexual dimorphism; the traveller fits in immediately, as he too is a  hermaphrodite.

The work is included among Nettlau's '<a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau">Utopies  libertaires</a>'. <a href="biblio.htm#Berneri">Berneri</a> has 17 pages on  this tale, which she describes as "an original and entertaining utopia."
