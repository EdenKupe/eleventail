Vittorio Curtoni refers the reader to these "stories of  sensual liberation" by Farmer. The Lovers, with its story of  forbidden love between a future human and a humanoid alien insect parasite,  broke new ground in SF when it first appeared. Strange Relations is a  collection of five stories all named for family relationships; most of them  feature bizarre alien sexuality. The best is 'Mother' (1953) (Curtoni: 25).
