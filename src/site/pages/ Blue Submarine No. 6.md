On a distant future Earth, in which the oceans have  flooded most of the planet, and most of humankind has been destroyed, submarine  forces wage war against a demented scientist and his hybrid marine beings, whom  he intends as our successors.
 
Seen by Connor Owens at <a href="https://solarpunkanarchists.com/tag/anime/">solarpunkanarchists.com</a>  as an ecological reflection on the human species's capacity for destruction, and  on whether a post-human world might be "for us death, but for you, a utopia".
