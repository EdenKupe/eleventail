. . . "writes many short stories whose heroes have no  truck with authority of any sort, though the conventions of the genre sometimes  get in the way of the essential messages of his stories." (Moorcock 1978)
 
Ellison is fond of Thoreau, and quotes him  repeatedly—for example in 'Silent in Gehenna' (1971), and '"Repent, Harlequin!",  said the Ticktockman' (1965). The latter story is a classic of individual  rebellion, near-anarchist in motivation; in 2015 it won the Prometheus Hall of  Fame Award.
