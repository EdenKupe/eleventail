The Day of The Triffids is a well-known disaster story centring on murderous plants. In The Kraken Wakes 4/5 of the world population dies from the onslaught of aliens who invade the ocean deeps. Both novels were named by D.R. in Freedom's 1958 review of Maine's The Tide Went Out, as earlier examples of the same genre.
