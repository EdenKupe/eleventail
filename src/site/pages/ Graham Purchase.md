Yet another sleeper awakes, this time to be given a guided tour of Bear City in the Cat-River bioregion, an eco-anarchist  (or green-syndicalist) utopia. (Dan Clore; Killjoy,  2009)
Â 
Worthy and rather laboured, but mercifully short.  Killjoy (2013) takes a more charitable view: "Its prose is clumsy but its  politics are fascinating" . . . .
