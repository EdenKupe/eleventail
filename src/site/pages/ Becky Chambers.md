Warm-hearted space opera, mercifully underplaying  'adventure', but strong on character, humour, gender, and unorthodox sexual  relationships. <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/chambers_becky">SFE</a>  comments on how the starship crew "eschews weapons and deals with its crises  using co-operation and diplomacy."
