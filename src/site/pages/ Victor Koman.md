All were Prometheus Award winners. The Jehovah Contract is a bold (but ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to tackle religion head-on,  the storyline concerning an assassin's mission to kill God. Though God and the  Devil both end up dead, the magickal Goddess survives, apparently with the  author's approval.
